# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking

Capstone project for Summer Analytics 2025 by Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Urban parking is often underutilized or overcrowded due to static pricing. In this project, we built a real-time dynamic pricing engine for 14 parking lots using historical and live data, built entirely from scratch using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Pathway.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Pathway (Real-time streaming)
- Bokeh (Visualization)
- Google Colab / Kaggle
- GitHub
